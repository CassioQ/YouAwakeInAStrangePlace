  - GM Lobby to view server details (name, password) and connected players.
  - Ability to "Start Game", transitioning players to the setup phase.
  - Monitor player progress during the initial game setup (dice rolls).
- **Player Flow:**
  - Join existing game servers using server name and password.
  - Player Lobby to see other connected players and wait for the GM to start.
  - Participate in a collaborative game setup phase:
    - **Dice Rolling:** Players roll 2d6 to determine roles in world definition.

- **Session Management:**
  - Prompts users to resume their previous game session (as GM or Player) if one is found.
  - Handles clearing of old session data when starting/joining new games.
- **Firebase Functions for Server Maintenance (Planned):**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd youawakeinastrangeplace
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase and OAuth configuration:

    ```env
    # Firebase Project Configuration (Get these from your Firebase project settings)
    FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
    FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
    FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
    FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional

    # OAuth Client IDs (Get these from Google Cloud Console and Facebook Developer Portal)
    EXPO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_EXPO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID" # Typically the Web Client ID for Expo Go/Web
    IOS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_IOS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
    ANDROID_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_ANDROID_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
    FACEBOOK_APP_ID="YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID"
    ```

    _Note: For the Gemini API, ensure `API_KEY` is set as an environment variable in your deployment/build environment. This app assumes `process.env.API_KEY` is available for Gemini calls._

4.  **Firebase Setup:**

    - Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Enable **Authentication** and configure the sign-in methods you want to support (Email/Password, Google, Facebook).
    - Set up **Firestore Database**.
    - **Security Rules:**
      - For development, you can use permissive rules (allowing authenticated users to read/write). **Remember to secure these for production!**
      - Example development rules for Firestore (`firestore.rules`):
        ```javascript
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow read/write for any authenticated user during development
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      - For more specific rules related to `userProfiles` and `gameServers`, refer to the examples provided during development iterations.

5.  **Firebase Functions (for Server Cleanup - Optional but Recommended for Production):**
    - If not already done, initialize Firebase Functions in your project root:
      ```bash
      firebase init functions
      ```
      (Choose TypeScript, install dependencies).
    - Add the `cleanupStaleGameServers` function code (provided in previous development steps) to `functions/src/index.ts`.
    - Deploy the function:
      ```bash
      firebase deploy --only functions
      ```
    - This requires your Firebase project to be on the **Blaze (Pay-as-you-go) plan** and might require enabling Google App Engine in your Google Cloud project for the specified region.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Runs the app in development mode using Expo CLI.
- `npm run android` or `yarn android`: Runs the app on an Android emulator or connected device.
- `npm run ios` or `yarn ios`: Runs the app on an iOS simulator or connected device (macOS only).
- `npm run web` or `yarn web`: Runs the app in a web browser.

## üîÆ Future Work / Roadmap

- Complete the world definition phase (Genre, Adjective, Location input by players).
- Implement interference token logic.
- Develop the full character creation process after world setup.
- Build the main gameplay screens for players and GMs.
- GM tools for narrative control and player management.
- More robust error handling and UI feedback.
